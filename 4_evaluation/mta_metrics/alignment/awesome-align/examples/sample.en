A 16-story hotel is proposed to be built next to Buckhead’s Lenox Square mall with a connection to PATH400.
The Hyatt Centric hotel would be built on a 1-acre site on the southeast edge of the mall near the George C. Bynum Jr. Pedestrian Bridge, which connects PATH400, a multiuse trail, over Ga. 400.
The hotel would have 221 rooms, a rooftop restaurant and outdoor dining, which would “activate” that part of PATH400, a planning document said.
The rooftop restaurant would feature “360-degree views of Buckhead and Downtown.”
The hotel would also have a fitness center and pool.
To improve connectivity to PATH400, 10-foot sidewalks be added to continue the width of the path, architects with Cooper Carry and Kimley-Horn said at the May 1 Special Public Interest District 12 meeting.
Bike lockers and 42 racks will be provided for people who use the path to get to the hotel and mall.
Livable Buckhead Executive Director Denise Starling said she believed the connection to PATH400 could be better by making the part of the hotel it would pass by more active.
Starling oversees the path’s construction and operation.
The hotel is proposed for the same site where the Center for Hard to Recycle Materials (CHaRM) was planned to go before the idea fell through last year.
The site is also next to a possible new Ga. 400 interchange being studied for feasibility.
Sally Silver, an SPI-12 board member who is also Councilmember Howard Shook’s policy analyst, recommended the hotel install one of the city’s Relay Bike Share stations and furnish their own rentable bicycles for PATH400 users.
Starling also recommended a parking place on site for electric scooters, like Bird and Lime.
The hotel will not add any vehicle parking and will use existing decks at other properties.
A 2.15m sea creature that washed ashore in Southern California has been identified as a hoodwinker sunfish, a recently identified rare species thought to live in the Southern Hemisphere.
The University of California, Santa Barbara, said an intern spotted the stranded fish last week at Sands Beach in the university's Coal Oil Point Natural Reserve.
The intern alerted Jessica Nielsen, a conservation specialist at Coal Oil Point who initially thought it was a type of local sunfish and posted photos to the reserve's Facebook page.
That drew the attention of Thomas Turner, an associate professor in UCSB's ecology, evolution and marine biology department who examined the fish and posted photos to the iNaturalist online community.
That caught the eye of Marianne Nyegaard of Murdoch University in Australia, who identified the species in 2017 and formally named it Mola tecta but gave it the hoodwinker moniker because it had somehow escaped scientific recognition.
Nyegaard told UCSB in an email that she discussed the images with ichthyologist Ralph Foster of the South Australian Museum but was reluctant to identify the fish as a hoodwinker because the photos didn't clearly show distinctive features and because it had turned up so far out of its known range.
Nyegaard sent specific instructions to California about what to photograph and tissue samples that should be taken.
The fish was just over 2.15m long and slightly wider 2.27m from fin tip to fin tip.
Photo / AP Turner and Nielsen were glad to help, but first they had to find the fish, which had been moved by the tide, according to UCSB.
They walked from opposite ends of the beach and found it several hundred yards from its original position.
Nyegaard said she ended up with a large number of extremely clear photos "and there was just no doubt of the ID."
Sunfish are odd-looking, flat and somewhat oval with fins that resemble little wings.
According to Thomas, the fish was just over 2.15m long and slightly wider 2.27m from fin tip to fin tip.
Its dorsal fin was just under 75cm long.
He did not measure the weight.
A David de Gea error kept the Red Devils from another clean sheet at Old Trafford in the league, and they sit on their fewest number in a half century Manchester United failed to keep a clean sheet at Old Trafford once again in their 1-1 draw against Chelsea and are now on pace for their fewest home shut-outs in over a half century.
Marcos Alonso scored late in the first half to bring Chelsea back from a goal down after Juan Mata had put United in front 1-0 just 11 minutes into the contest.
The goal was the result of another error by David de Gea, was the Red Devils No.1 continues to struggle with his third mistake leading to a goal in four games.
The failure to keep a clean sheet at Old Trafford is nothing new for United this season, as they have managed it just twice in the Premier League this term.
A scoreless draw against Crystal Palace in November, and another against Liverpool in February were the only times in league play this season where the Red Devils have held their opposition off the board in front of the home fans.
Currently, United have kept a clean sheet in just 11 per cent of their games, or two of the 18, at Old Trafford.
That is their worst percentage since the 1962-63 season, when the Red Devils kept clean sheets in just two of their 21 home games, or 9.5 per cent.
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men will have one more chance this season to keep the opposition at bay at Old Trafford, when they face Cardiff City on the final day of the Premier League season.
They will also look to improve on their offensive performance in the process after taking just seven shots in the Chelsea draw.
Since the 2003-04 season, United have only managed fewer attempts on four occasions at Old Trafford.
The Red Devils are now winless in four games and their dry spell could not have come at worst time in the race for the top four.
Article continues below United sit in sixth on 65 points, three points behind Chelsea in fourth and five behind Tottenham in third with just two games remaining for each side.
They will need help if they want to make the top four, as not only will Chelsea have to drop multiple points, but Arsenal, just ahead of United on the table on 66 points, will have to as well.
The good news for the Red Devils is that they host Cardiff, who may be relegated by that final day, as well as bottom of the table Huddersfield in the penultimate clash of the campaign, so they will have the opportunity to take maximum points from their remaining matches.
A Melbourne man who killed his girlfriend in a "gruesome" beating with a barbell while their baby daughter slept nearby has been jailed for 24 years.
Shane Michael Robertson murdered his 29-year-old partner Katherine Haley at their Diggers Rest home on March 9 last year as she sought to escape his increasingly controlling behaviour.
Robertson, now 29, must serve at least 19 years' jail for what Supreme Court Justice John Champion described as a savage assault, motivated by his possessiveness after months of extreme jealousy.
The court room was packed with more than 50 of Ms Haley's family and friends.
Eight victim impact statements described the family's trauma at losing a compassionate and caring daughter, sister and mother with a "trademark smile".
It would have devastated her to see her children, aged seven and one, separated as they have been after her death, her father said.
Justice Champion said the attack left Ms Haley with substantial injuries to her face and head, and an autopsy was unable to determine how many times she was hit by Robertson with the heavy iron bar.
Ms Haley had told him she wanted to leave the relationship, which had deteriorated because of his behaviour.
He became obsessed with the idea she was seeing other men after starting a new job, had been watching her at work and set up fake social media profiles to contact her colleagues about her contact with others.
They had returned from dinner and put their baby daughter to bed before the fatal events.
He later called his mother, telling her "I've done it.
I've bashed her brains in.
There is brains everywhere" and that "I didn't mean it".
A Rhode Island child welfare worker is on administrative leave and three others are on restrictive duty following the arrest of a Warwick woman accused of neglecting a 9-year-old girl with special needs after the child died.
Emotions laced the voice of Department of Children, Youth and Families Director Trista Piccola as she spoke about the immediate changes she was implementing following the death of the unnamed 9-year-old.
Michele Rothgeb, 55, was arrested on Sunday at her Oakland Beach Avenue home and faces one charge of cruelty or neglect of a child, according to WJAR.
Court documents obtained by WJAR state that the suspect has eight adopted children with special needs in a home with deplorable conditions.
Piccola confirmed that the children were found in "entirely unacceptable" conditions, and that when social workers were investigating the family in January of 2018, they were not allowed access to the home's second floor.
She said she did not have an answer for how eight children found themselves in this situation.
The documents obtained by WJAR note that the girl was left in a bathtub for three-and-a-half hours to eight hours on Jan. 3 after Rothgeb allegedly instructed her 15-year-old adopted grandson to take care of the other children.
Rothgeb told investigators she was sick with the flu when she left the other children’s care in the hands of the teen.
The teen told police he helped the girl, who was wheelchair bound, into the tub.
He left the girl in the tub with a few inches of water in it, then went to care for the other kids.
The girl was later found unresponsive several hours later.
She was taken to Kent Hospital after the 15-year-old called 911, according to WJAR.
She was pronounced dead at the medical center.
In the court documents, officials said the house smelled strongly of urine and waste.
They state that garbage was spewed all over the house and spoiled bedding that looked as if it hadn’t been changed in months were in the home.
Authorities say the house was so cluttered that the child would not be able to use her wheelchair inside.
The names of the DCYF employees who have been placed on administrative leave and restricted duty were not immediately released.
A barrage of instant criticism started coming Pandya’s way, prompting the Indian Cricket Board to consider banning players from appearing on such chat shows.
India cricketer Hardik Pandya has apologised after being slammed for making what many construed as misogynistic and sexist remarks on ‘Koffee With Karan’, saying he got “carried away by the nature” of the show.
The 25-year-old all-rounder has provoked a backlash after the comments he made on the celebrity chat show hosted by film maker Karan Johar, in which he appeared with India teammate K.L. Rahul.
Taking to Twitter, Pandya posted, “After reflecting on my comments on Koffee with Karan, I would like to apologise to everyone concerned who I may have hurt in any way.
Honestly, I got a bit carried away with the nature of the show.
In no way did I mean to disrespect or hurt anyone’s sentiments.
Respect.”
On the show, Pandya boasted about hooking up with multiple women and spoke about how open he is with his parents, saying he had once told them after losing his virginity, “aaj mai kar ke aaya.”
When the host of the show asked him why didn’t he ask women their name in a club, Pandya responded by saying, “I like to watch and observe how they (women) move.
I’m little from the black side so I need to see how they move.”
The BCCI had Tuesday taken note of his “crass and cringeworthy comments” on the chat show and had ticked him off.
Pandya is currently with the Indian team in Australia where they recently recorded a historic maiden Test series win.
Pandya had joined the team before the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne after recovering from a back injury which he had suffered during the Asia Cup in UAE last year.
He will be seen in action in the three-match ODI series against Australia which starts on January 12 in Sydney.
A bid has been launched to reopen a Brentwood restaurant that was closed in the aftermath of the alleged murder of a Christmas holiday reveller outside.
Andreas Artemi has applied for a premises licence for the Vine in Brentwood – around eight months after it was forced to close in the light of the death of Paul Wallington in December last year.
Mr Artemi, who was a director of the High Street bar before its closure after Brentwood Borough Council revoked its icence in January, wants permission to reopen from 10am to midnight Monday to Wednesday, 10am to 1am on Thursdays and Sundays and 10am to 2am on Fridays and Saturdays.
The bar at the centre of a murder investigation had its licence suspended due to a “lack of control by management of the doorstaff”.
Paul Wallington, 25, died five days after an altercation outside The Vine, at around 11.50pm on Christmas Eve.
He was taken to Queen’s Hospital in Romford and later transferred to the neurocritical care unit.
However, he was pronounced dead at 3.03pm on December 29.
In the aftermath of his death, Essex Police launched a murder investigation and arrested a 29-year-old man from Basildon.
He has been released on bail until September 2.
Having “received concerns by members of the community”, Essex Police requested a review of The Vine’s licence.
At the time chief inspector Lewis Basford, district commander for Brentwood and Epping, said: “The seriousness of this incident means we have no other option but to request the suspension of its licence.”
Since then the bar has remained vacant and unused.
Mr Artemi, a former Southend Utd midfielder, owns The Vine in Southend.
