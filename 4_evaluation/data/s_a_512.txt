his Achilles heel
found their Mr Right and Ms Right
a Young Turk in the company
a bird in the hand
found a cuckoo in the nest
a hard nut to crack
was having a lot on the plate
having a roof over your head
has a screw loose
she received a wakeup call
being a wet blanket
had a whale of a time
it's a whole new ball game
started a witch hunt
the acid test for their relationship
improvements across the board
they added fuel to the flames
were racing against the clock
going against the grain
was staying ahead of the curve
staying ahead of the pack
they aired their dirty laundry
it's all Greek to me
be all ears
the new fashion trend was all the rage
went all the way up
became an item
had ants in his pants
being an apple polisher
to compare apples to apples
walked arm in arm
as far as the eye can see
as long as the rope
asked for the moon
asleep at the switch
asleep at the wheel
kept it at an arm's length
at daggers drawn with each other
She started at the bottom of the ladder
ready at the drop of a dime
ready at the drop of a hat
at the helm of the project
it ate her alive
had an axe to grind
he had his back against the wall
She backed the wrong horse
the backroom boys
turned out to be a bad egg
was carrying a ball and chain
presented the bare bones
was barking up the wrong tree
had bats in the belfry
to batten down the hatches
baying for blood
on a collision course with each other
stop beating around the bush
beat the drum for the cause
had a bee in her bonnet
has been tailor made
began to see the light
behind closed doors
bouncing off the walls
bend over backwards for them
got bent out of shape
bent their ears
She bet on the wrong horse
caught between a rock and a hard place
Between you and me, there's a secret
she looked beyond the veil
watched by big brother
the big cheese
to bring in the big gun
has a big mouth
I have bigger fish to fry
bit his head off
he bit off more than he could chew
bit the hand that fed
we gathered the bits and pieces
a dose of bitter medicine
to swallow a bitter pill
was bruised black and blue
was found in the black book
a black hole in the system
the black sheep in their midst
had a blazing row
as blind as a bat
blew away the competition
blew their cover
blow his own horn
blowing his own trumpet
a blue blood family
the blue-eyed boy
not born yesterday
their bread and butter
to break a leg on stage
break down the situation
breaking the ice together
breaking the mould
decided to break up
a bright spark
to buckle down to work
to build bridges between them
the building blocks of success
has a bun in the oven
burned bridges with them
They burned their fingers
burning the candle at both ends
buried their heads in the sand
to butter up the boss
She called a spade a spade
opened a can of worms
had a card up his sleeve
carrying the torch for her
cash in on the opportunity
building castles in the air
caught him napping
to catch up with her
gave them chapter and verse
it was child's play
a chill wind blew
found a chink in their armour
he started to choke up
to clamp down on the situation
to start with a clean slate
made a clean sweep
we cleared the air with her
We cleared the decks for the event
had a close call
a cloud on the horizon
the coast is clear
coining money together
She got cold feet
going cold turkey
came across the old book
decided to come clean
came down with something
came full circle
he came out swinging
cooked his goose
were cooling their heels
was counting chickens before they hatch
cracked the whip on the team
crossed swords with him
crossed the bridge together
He crossed the line with her
have a crush
crying over spilt milk
not my cup of tea
a cut and dried decision
cut their coat according to their cloth
cut corners on the project
cut the cord with her
couldn't cut the mustard
cut his own throat
danced to the tune
dancing on their grave
a dead duck in the situation
found it dead in the water
deep down in the ocean
delivered the goods on time
died in harness
was digging his own grave
that should do the trick
dodged a bullet there
does exactly what it says on the tin
a double-edged sword in this situation
a down-to-earth person
was drawing a blank
to drive a wedge between them
driving me up the wall
dropped a bombshell during the meeting
drop by the store
eat him alive in the competition
to address the elephant in the room
that's the end of the story
they searched every nook and cranny
packed everything but the kitchen sink
they faced the music together
fell at the first hurdle
fell between the cracks
to fall on his sword
to fall on our feet
They had a fall out
fanned the flames together
a feather in your cap
feathering her own nest
he started to feel the pinch
had feet of clay
fiddled while Rome burned
filled the bill perfectly
all fingers and thumbs
a flash in the pan
my own flesh and blood
was foaming at the mouth
got a foot in the door
learned it from A to Z
seemed full of beans
they decided to get hitched
They got their feet wet
got out of bed on the wrong side
She got the sack from the company
got the wrong end of the stick
got your goat
gets it out of his system
up getting my fingers burnt
gave it a shot
he gave it a whirl
gave him the slip
hit the glass ceiling
the gloves are off now
went down in flames
going round in circles
they decided to go steady
he went the extra mile
going through a rough patch
went through channels to get
went through the roof
got in his hair
they've got it made
finally got off your back
looking green around the gills
you had your chips
went at it hammer and tongs
walked hand in hand
my hands are tied
She experienced hard cheese
has a big mouth
has a soft spot for kittens
she maintained clean hands throughout the process
had kittens over the situation
have no truck with them
was keeping her head above water
hiding light under a bushel
so high up
time to hit the books
hit the bull's-eye
time to hit the hay
hit the nail on the head
hit the road together
hit the roof unexpectedly
she decided to hit the sack
he held all the aces
They held their tongue
hold your horses for a moment
stirred up a hornets' nest
handled the hot potato
she became a household name
hung out to dry
the icing on the cake
lost in a fog
She explained it in a nutshell
found themselves in a pickle
was thrown in at the deep end
in bed with the competition
to put it in black and white
he found himself in deep water
the party was in full swing
found himself in hot water
it's in her blood
finally in the black
caught in the cross hairs
were kept in the dark
in the doghouse with her
kept in the loop
the company is in the red
to stay in touch
it's a small world after all
had jam on his face
was acting as judge, jury, and executioner
jumped on the bandwagon
it's a jungle out there
the jury's out on that decision
just off the boat
just what the doctor ordered
she kept him at arm's length
they kept their cards close to their chest
kept the wolf from the door
keeping your nose clean
kicked the bucket together
kicked themselves
killed two birds with one stone
to kiss and make up with her
a knee jerk reaction to the news
she knocked on wood
he knew the ropes well
knows which side his bread is buttered
knowing which way the wind blows
led them astray
was leaning towards that option
made progress in leaps and bounds
learn to walk before you run
He left her at the altar
gave her a leg up
let the cat out of the bag
licked his wounds after the fight
They licked their lips
he decided to lie low
the lights are on but nobody is home
to draw a line in the sand
getting long in the tooth
in the long run
to look before you leap
looked through colored glasses
became a loose cannon
lost his marbles
lowered the bar for everyone
I had a lump in my throat
made a song and dance about it
was struggling to make ends meet
They made their bed and lied on it
makes his hackles rise
makes my ears burn
a man's best friend
mending fences with her
seemed miles away
on minding your own beeswax
were minding their own business
She missed the boat on that opportunity
generated more heat than light
my hands are full at the moment
a real nail biter
put the final nail in the coffin
never looked back after that
not a spring chicken anymore
not getting anywhere with this
wouldn't hurt a fly
not playing with a full deck
started living off grid
an old hat at
an old school approach
served it on a silver platter
the city was on its knees
waiting on pins and needles
put it on the back burner
on the brink of something
riding on the crest of a wave
on the edge of their seat
was left on the hook
She put it on the line
right on the money
was riding on the pig's back
be on the same page
opened old wounds
got out of hand
came out of the closet
jumped out of the frying pan into the fire
going out on the town
over my dead body
over the moon about the news
to paddle their own canoe
to paint the town red together
passed away peacefully
passed on the baton to her
passed the buck to her
passed the torch to her
a pie in the sky
a real piece of work
told them to pipe down
played cat and mouse
playing second fiddle to her
She plays with fire
pricked up their ears
pulled a rabbit out of the hat
was pulling my leg
pull the plug on the project
They pulled the wool over her eyes
to pull your socks up
we pushed the boat out
to put a sock in it
they put their cards on the table
He put his heart into the project
putting the cart before the horse
put the clock back an hour
put your foot in it
He put his head on the block
made a queer pitch
rain or shine, we'll be there
raised eyebrows at the meeting
raised the bar for everyone
they found rats in the attic
a ray of sunshine in the room
looked ready to drop
to recharge their batteries
found a red herring
to ring a bell for them
to rip off the cover
rise and shine
rocked the boat a bit
their roots run deep
rubbed shoulders with the famous
rubbed him the wrong way
to run across the field
run out of time
ran out of steam
to sail through the challenges
scratched the surface
found a second wind
seeing eye to eye with her
finally saw the light
set the bar high
they saw shades of grey
shaking a leg
shooting from the hip
has a short fuse
he took a shot in the dark
showed him the door
showed their true colors
was born with a silver spoon
a sink or swim situation
sitting on the fence
to sit tight and wait
skating on thin ice
we discovered a skeleton in the closet
smelled a rat in the situation
I smelled something fishy
experience smooth sailing
She found a snake in the grass
He found a snake in the shoes
snowed under with work
a spanner in the works
spilled the beans about the surprise
spun a yarn together
stabbed in the back by a friend
stand out in the crowd
stepped on his toes
stuck in his throat
he maintained a stiff upper lip
stirred up a hornet's nest
stop by the store
stopped the rot
heard it straight from the horse's mouth
a straight shooter
to straighten up and fly right
to strike while the iron is hot
was suited and booted for the event
they swept the issue under the rug
He took a back seat to her
took a beating
take a cue from her
to take a hike
take a leaf out of her book
he took it on the chin
He took up the cudgels for her
to take it with a grain of salt
it takes two to tango
a tall poppy among them
by tarring them with the same brush
she gave him a taste of his own medicine
was tearing a strip off the fabric
that's going too far
the ball is in your court now
get the ball rolling
the devil is beating his wife
the early bird catches the worm
at the eleventh hour
that was the last straw
entered the lion's den
consider the other side of the coin
the sun rises and sets on them
to throw it over the wall
throw the baby out with the bathwater
tied the knot together
found themselves in a tight spot
to tighten the belt a bit
just the tip of the iceberg
to see the back of the problem
shaken to the core
tooting his own horn
became the top dog
tore your hair out
they discovered a treasure trove
She turned back on the situation
turned down a glass
twisted his arm
an ugly duckling story
was working under the radar
found ourselves up a creek without a paddle
found ourselves up a river without a paddle
plans are up in the air
not quite up to the mark
experienced ups and downs
They used their loaf
was wearing a velvet glove
a voice in the wilderness
the vultures are circling
was wagging the dog
wanted his head on a platter
They washed their dirty linen in public
washed their hands of the situation
hired a watchdog
went through the mill together
still wet behind the ears
wet the baby's head
whatever floats my boat
the wheels fell off
when the chips are down
where the rubber meets the road
was whistling in the dark
She read the white paper
She went the whole nine yards
that idea will never fly
wiped the slate clean together
received a wooden spoon
they found a worm in the apple
wouldn't be seen dead in that
wrapped in cotton wool
written all over her face
has a yellow streak
can't have the cake and the topping, too
can't have the cake and eat it
reap what you sow
to zip it up
