"Instructions: In this dataset, we consider subsentences with idioms (e.g., ""They got our feet wet"") that are ambiguous between literal and figurative interpretations. We are asking you to translate two sentences containing the subsentence, one that is literal and one that is figurative. The translation of the figurative sentence should translate the meaning of the idiom, rather than translating it literally. For instance, you would say ""They got familiar with"" in your target language. If there is an equivalent idiom in the target language (same meaning AND same surface form), you can use it and select the top checkbox for Equivalent Idiom (ignore the second one, we cannot systematically delete it). If there is a corresponding idiom with a different surface form, you may use it for the figurative translation, and you do not need to indicate anything extra. If the original source sentence has serious fluency/coherence issues and/or there is no natural translation, you may select the Nonsensical checkbox and skip the translation.

The subsentence in the source sentence is demarcated in double square brackets. When writing the translation, please additionally mark the span(s) corresponding to the subsentence in square brackets. ",,,,,,,,
