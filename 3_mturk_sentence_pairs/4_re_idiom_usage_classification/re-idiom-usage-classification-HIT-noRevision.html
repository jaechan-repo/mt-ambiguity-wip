                Your task is to <b>identify the usage of an idiom within a sentence</b>. For each pair of idioms and sentences provided, you must select an option that best describes the meaning of the idiom given the context of the sentence. 
                
                <br><br>
                In this instruction, we use the idiom "piece of cake" as a running example. The sentence and the idiom will be presented to you in the following format:
                <br>

                <div class='text-base bg-stone-200 p-3 rounded-lg my-5'>
                    <p class="text-lg">The boy found the project to be a piece of cake because he planned far ahead</p>
                    <p class=""><b><i>[Dictionary Definition]</i> "piece of cake" :</b> something easily achieved</p>
                </div>

                Note that we also provide the dictionary definition of the idiom in case you are unfamiliar with it.

                <br><br><hr><br>

                <h2 class="font-bold text-xl my-2">Idiomatic, Literal, Ambiguous</h2>
        
                Given the idiom and the sentence formatted as above, your responsibility is to select one among these four options:
                
                <br><br>

                If the idiom is used in its <b>idiomatic meaning</b> within the sentence (i.e., used figuratively rather than literally), then select the option <nobr class="text-white bg-red-700 p-0.5">idiomatic</nobr>. Please feel free to use the provided <b><i>[Dictionary Definition] </i></b> as a reference for deciding if the idiom was used figuratively. 
                <p class="ml-8 mt-2 text-sm">
                    The sentence shown in the format above, <i>The boy found the project to be a piece of cake because he planned far ahead</i>, is a clear example of an idiomatic use. The piece of cake does not refer to a cake as literal sweet food; it tells how easy the project was for the boy. 
                </p>
                
                <br>
                    
                If the idiom is used in its <b>literal meaning</b> within the sentence, then select <nobr class="text-white bg-blue-700 p-0.5">literal</nobr>. 
                <p class="ml-8 mt-2 text-sm">
                    The sentence <i>The boy ate a piece of cake for his dessert</i> is a literal use. The piece of cake refers to an actual food with no hidden meanings behind it.
                </p>
                
                <br>
                
                If it can be interpreted <b>either way</b> (either figuratively or literally), then select <nobr class="text-white bg-purple-700 p-0.5">ambiguous</nobr>. 
                <p class="ml-8 mt-2 text-sm">
                    The sentence <i>That was a piece of cake</i> is an ambiguous use of the idiom. The sentence might be literally referring to a breadlike food or metaphorically portraying how easy whatever "that" was. Since it can be freely interpreted either way, the correct option is "ambiguous".
                </p>
                <div class="ml-8 mt-1 text-sm">
                    <p class="text-red-600">WARNING: The relatively short length of a sentence is NOT a proper justification for selecting <nobr class="text-white bg-purple-700 p-0.5">ambiguous</nobr>. For example, consider the sentence <i>Julia has never thought the whole thing would be a piece of cake</i>. Although the sentence is moderately long, the interpretation is still ambiguous.</p>
                </div>
                
                <br>

                If you are unsure which of the three categories above the idiom does not fall into, then select <nobr class="text-white bg-black p-0.5">discard</nobr>.

                <h2 class="font-bold text-xl my-2">Important Notes on Discard</h2>

                Discards are important; they help us know what sentences are inherently problematic. 
                
                The specific reasons you may select <nobr class="text-white bg-black p-0.5">discard</nobr> are the following:
                <ol class="list-disc ml-8 mt-2">
                    <li>
                        <div>
                            One primary issue you should be seeking is whether the provided sentence exhibits <b>inconsistent idiomatic or literal usage</b>. Select <nobr class="text-white bg-black p-0.5">discard</nobr> if the given sentence fluctuates between idiomatic and literal, resulting in an overall sense of <b>disjointedness and a lack of fluency</b>.
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="mt-2">
                            This must not be confused with a <nobr class="text-white bg-purple-700 p-0.5">ambiguous</nobr> sentence. An ambiguous sentence has the attribute that it can be interpreted either idiomatically or literally, with both interpretations presenting as natural and coherent in their own respect. In contrast, a <nobr class="text-white bg-black p-0.5">discard</nobr> sentence has interpretive inconsistency, with half of its content appearing literal and the other half idiomatic, which when combined, disrupts the natural flow of the sentence. This concept can be better illustrated through examples.
                        </div>
                        <div class="px-2 py-1">
                            <div class="mt-3">
                                <i>[Discard Example] "he's a hard nut to crack and a hammer couldn't break it open"</i>
                                <p class="ml-8 my-2 text-sm">
                                    The use of "he" at the start indicates that the phrase "a hard nut to crack" is being used in an idiomatic sense. However, the sentence then shifts to talk about physically cracking a nut with a hammer. Can you spot the issue here? The sentence doesn't stay consistently figurative or literal, resulting in an unnatural, nonsensical sentence.. In cases like this, your best choice is to select <nobr class="text-white bg-black p-0.5">discard</nobr>.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="mt-3">
                                <i>[Ambiguous (Non-Discard) Example] "they are hard nuts to crack"</i>
                                <p class="ml-8 my-2 text-sm">
                                    Whatever the subject "they" refers to, it's either you're dealing with particularly resilient pistachios that refuse to open (literal), or you've got a bunch of people around you who have complex personality codes (idiomatic).  Despite this ambiguity, the sentence is still logical and coherent. In such instances, you should select <nobr class="text-white bg-purple-700 p-0.5">ambiguous</nobr>.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="mt-3">
                                <i>[Now Test Yourself] "This business is a house of cards, which was constructed using poker cards"</i>
                                <p class="ml-8 my-2 text-sm">
                                    Similar to the previous examples, the phrase "a house of cards" in reference to a business is idiomatic, as "business" is an abstract notion. However, the sentence then oddly transitions to discussing the physical act of building with poker cards, illogically trying to literalize the previously figurative phrase. This results in a nonsensical sentence. In such situations, you should opt for <nobr class="text-white bg-black p-0.5">discard</nobr>.
                                </p>

                            e.g., <i>The boy ran across the field</i>
                        </p>
                    <li>The sentence is <b>too unnatural, ungrammatical, or implausible</b> for one to comprehend.</li>
                        <p class="ml-8 my-2 text-sm">
                            e.g., <i>The piece of cake ate the boy</i>
                        </p>
                    <li>The sentence makes <b>excessively many adjustments to the idiom</b> that the idiom no longer holds its idiomatic interpretation. 
                        
                        <p class="ml-8 my-2 text-sm">
                            e.g.,  consider the phrase <i>"The boy found the project to be a fragment of cake because he planned ahead"</i>. While "fragment" and "piece" are typically interchangeable, using "fragment of cake" here disrupts the recognizability of the well-known idiom "piece of cake".
                        </p>

                    <li>The sentence is <b>inherently offensive</b>.</li>
                        <p class="ml-8 my-2 text-sm">
                            e.g., <i>Being Asian is quite a piece of cake—just act submissive all the time</i>

                            The order of words in an idiom matters! Once you start using the phrase "kick the bucket" in a passive form ("the bucket is kicked"), the phrase is no longer an idiom. Since there is an inherent problem in the use of this idiom, the sentence must be discarded.

                    We have noticed from the recent batches that some workers tend to choose "ambiguous" when there is the slightest sense of ambiguity present in a sentence. However, we would like to emphasize that if a sentence leans significantly towards a figurative or literal interpretation, that interpretation should be selected, even if there's a minimal possibility for an alternative interpretation.
