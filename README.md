# Idiomatic Machine Translation Evaluation Benchmark and Dataset

> The meaning of a word is its use in the language. (Ludwig Wittgenstein, _Philosophical Investigations_)

The goal of this project is to create a benchmark that evaluates a natural language modelâ€™s capability to accurately translate semantically ambiguous English sentences. Despite recent advances in Transformers and their increasingly robust performance on popular MT evaluation metrics, the translation of meanings beyond forms, such as lexically and structurally ambiguous sentences, remains unsolved. We propose a new benchmark that examines how well the meanings of sentences with English idiomatic expressions are preserved when translated into a target language. For additional challenges, the idioms may occur in the sentences either figuratively, literally, or ambiguously, which will help us further evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between the different usages of the same phrase.

# Outline

## [Chapter 1. English Idioms](/1_english_idioms/README.md)

English idioms and their usages are collected from two different sources: [EPIE Corpus](https://github.com/prateeksaxena2809/EPIE_Corpus) (a corpus of idioms and their instances scraped within a dataset) and [Theidioms.com](https://www.theidioms.com/list/) (an educational website that lists idioms, their meanings, and their instances).
