The punitive calculus , with its just deserts gloss , may have political appeal and offer an antidote to the soft image that has beset the Service since its inception .
These have included the revival of the philosophy of ‘ just deserts ’ ( see Chapter 2 ) — and , we would add , what we shall be calling ‘ law and order ideology ’ .
Jailed mugger got just deserts , says his family
This was so whether the reformative sentence would be disproportionately long or disproportionately short , although most adherents of the Justice Model in the 1970s ( who tended to be liberal or moderately radical in political persua-sion ) wanted a just deserts system which would punish less harshly overall — again like Beccaria two centuries previously .
In its four quarters he kept his four ‘ wives ’ , each totally oblivious of the others , until sheer misfortune led to his discovery and his just deserts .

The fact that a woman , Margaret Thatcher , smashed the biggest glass ceiling of all in 1979 and that women have been storming into business and Government with ever more determination and success than before , should point the way for the hospitality industry .
In the games room , supported by slate and iron pillars , a tracery of iron girders held the low glass ceiling .
But the study shows that those dedicated to breaking through the ‘ glass ceiling ’ on their careers are prepared to sacrifice having a family ; the nine women tested had only five children between them ; the six men had 10 .
The administration 's left hand may continue to fight it as a quota measure , while its right comes close to endorsing quotas to break the glass ceiling .
That may seem a softly-softly approach , but by making aspiring women managers and executives feel more comfortable with the management culture , it could prove effective in shattering the glass ceiling .
And few of the people who hit the glass ceiling are inclined to go through the additional pain of a complaint to the government or a court case .
But how will we know when the glass ceiling has gone .
The glass ceiling does not exist because they do not let it .
A failure to realise just how tough it is means such women are held back more by their own glass hat than any supposed glass ceiling .
There are three reasons for this : first , women dress differently from ‘ 20 men all wearing pinstripe suits ’ , making them more memorable ; second , they offload their emotions over redundancy much more quickly , making them better prepared to look for a new position ; and third , because of the so-called ‘ glass ceiling ’ , those women who do make it to the top are ‘ slightly better ’ than their male competitors .
Like many women who have crashed through the glass ceiling — or , perhaps , ignored it — she is strongly opposed to positive discrimination in favour of women and has little time for the argument that women do not succeed because they are women .
At least that way there is no way you can be held back by the so-called ‘ glass ceiling ’ — the phrase coined in the United States to describe the invisible barriers that allow women to rise only so far in an organisation .
The vast arched glass ceiling adds to the sense of space and grandure .
We have got to recognise that many women in our organisation , for example , perceive a glass ceiling .
There is still an unspoken assumption that it will be the women who make the sacrifices when it comes to childcare and it is perhaps the thickest glass ceiling of all for many women .
The ‘ glass ceiling ’ — the invisible barrier to high promotion — has however been breached and the numbers are rising steadily .
Feminists in the party claim there is a glass ceiling which most women can not break through to win the most influential posts .
On January 14th the unlikely figure of Bob Dole , the Senate Republican leader , took time off from the Gulf to call for a statutory commission to find out why women have not broken through the ‘ glass ceiling ’ that keeps them from top management jobs .
Not only was she the first female to break through the glass ceiling in Engineering , but to become a star throughout the company because she did the job with such panache ?

‘ As for value for money , it was not per se my main concern but reorienting it from an activity-based approach of what the cost of something was to VFM in terms of delivery to the patient — evaluating what we were doing well in the sense you or I as doctor-patient would expect , the outcomes of value to the patient , establishing how much it costs to deliver ( something we could not do but are better at now ) and then asking if it is reasonable value for money or , more interestingly , why it is cheaper in one place than another , benchmarking it . ’

It is most unlikely for an odour per se to cause actual physical damage , but where it causes a diminution in the selling value of the property or injures the plaintiff 's business by , for example , causing potential customers to be lost , this may be regarded as sufficient invasion of the plaintiff 's interest to be tortious .

The concept of referential rigidity in the sense in which it is used in the above theory , on the other hand , goes beyond this in that it already presupposes the idea of " per se " existence .
