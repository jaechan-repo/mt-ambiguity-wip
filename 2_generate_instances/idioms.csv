a sorry sight,something that is very sad or pitiful to look at.,"He exhibits a number of adjectives which differ in precisely the way required while maintaining the same or essentially the same lexical value ( we modify his examples slightly where it is possible to do so without damage to his case , so as to make the distinction sharper ) : ( 19 ) visible stars vs stars visible the only navigable rivers vs the only rivers navigable a handy tool vs are your tools handy ? guilty people vs people guilty As it happens , the examples which Bolinger uses employ words which can make the distinction a rather subtle one , with perhaps the exception of visible stars ( a group recognized astronomically ) beside stars visible ; but it is quite easy to produce further instances which seem to confirm his view : ( 20 ) a complaining visitor vs a visitor complaining the eligible bachelor vs the bachelor eligible In other cases , the divergence of lexical value between the two positions may be greater but still with the characteristic value for the former , and the occasion value for the latter : ( 21 ) the responsible man vs the man responsible a sorry sight vs the girl is sorry He notes that the acceptability of an adjective in pre-adjunct position may apparently depend on whether or not it can be regarded as indicating a relatively enduring characteristic of what is expressed by the noun , as in : ( 22 ) the faint girl vs the girl is faint an asleep man vs a man asleep This possibility of course depends not only on the adjective itself but also on the nature of the noun being qualified , so that "" when one scratches one 's head the result is not *a scratched head but when one scores a glass surface the result is a scratched surface "" .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-IDIOM I-IDIOM I-IDIOM O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

above suspicion,beyond reproach; having no suspicion of wrongdoing.,"Moreover , Cynewulf , king of the West Saxons , is not found ( apart from the unacceptable evidence of CS 208 : S 108 ) in Offa 's entourage , nor does Offa 's confirmation of Cynewulf 's grant of land at North Stoke , north of Bath ( itself not above suspicion ) , to the monastery of Bath in the territory of the Hwicce ( CS 327 : S 265 ) necessarily imply a position of dependence on Offa .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-IDIOM I-IDIOM O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

parts of other property , surely in all parties interest that none of these are resolved , so it is surely in all party interest that those , those are resolved contemporary and then the letter goes on to dealing with questions of valuation , the bottom paragraph on page thirty two in the bundle says in answer to your letter therefore is that there is no agreement to pay interest , if there is then my client must be credited with interest on his costs , and then it says surgery and finally if ove if overall agreement can not be reached then my client reserves his rights on the issue of
